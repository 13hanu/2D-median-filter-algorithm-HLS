# 2D-median-filter-algorithm-HLS
Using high-level synthesis, develop a hardware version of the 2D median filter algorithm (HLS). Then, apply HLS to accelerate the code utilising FPGA hardware. The hardware implementation should be optimised so that it can denoise the test image in less than 3 milliseconds while consuming less than 25 percent of the available PL resources.
